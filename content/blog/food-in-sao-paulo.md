## Burguers

- [Holy Burguer](https://www.instagram.com/holyburgersp/): when I went, the place was tiny and always packed. I was there on holiday, showed up around lunchtime, got there half an hour before they even opened, and there were already four people in line. I tried the burger that’s ranked [number 3 in the world](https://www.burgerdudes.se/the-worlds-best-burgers/), and yeah—it was really good. The pastrami coxinhas are also a must-try.

- [Big Kahuna Burger](https://www.instagram.com/bigkahunaburgerr/): they call themselves “The Temple of Bacon” and honestly, anything with bacon there is worth trying. They even serve bacon milkshakes.

- [Bullguer](https://www.instagram.com/bullguer/): its a burguer chain with many units in São Paulo. Very good value for money. I really like their fries and mayo.

## Italian

- [MoMa (Modern Mamma Osteria)](https://www.instagram.com/modernmammaosteria/): my favorite Italian restaurant in São Paulo, hands down. The Lasanheta de Vitelo is my go-to every single time.

## Pizzas

- [Veridiana](https://www.instagram.com/veridianapizzaria/): too many good options. If you want to try something different, there is a Lindt white chocolate pizza that I recommend your order for dessert.

## Bakeries

- [Jules L'art du Pain](https://www.instagram.com/padariajules/): french bakery. Sometimes I'll hear people speaking french in the line so it must be the real deal. They have my favorite chocolate croissant.

- [Feito à Mão](https://www.instagram.com/feitoamao.sp/): their mortadela french toast is amazing.

## Churrascarias/Steak Houses

- [Fuego Celeste](https://www.instagram.com/fuegocelesteoficial/): amazing quality and a good value for your money.

- [Santa Fé](https://www.instagram.com/santafeocupim/): you have to try the Cupim Casqueirado.
