## About

My name is Ernesto Matos. I'm a Computer Scientist/Software Engineer living in
SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I got a MSc and a Ph.D in computer science during
my time at [DIMAp/UFRN](http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/) (and [HHU](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/en/home.html)
for almost a year). During my time in
academia I did research on software testing and formal methods.

I'm currently working as Software Engineer at [Loggi](https://www.loggi.com/)
trying to reinvent logistics through technology.
