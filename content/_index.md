### About

I'm Ernesto. I'm a Computer Scientist/Software Engineer living in
SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I got a MSc and a Ph.D in computer science during
my time at [DIMAp/UFRN](http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/) (and [HHU](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/en/home.html)
for almost a year). During my time in
academia I did research on software testing and formal methods.

I'm currently working as Software Engineer at [Loggi](https://www.loggi.com/)
trying to reinvent logistics through technology.

### Projects

BETA: stands for B basEd Testing Approach. It is a tool-supported approach, based on the B-Method formal notation, to generate test cases. It uses restrictions described on a B model, such as invariants, preconditions and conditional statements, to create unit tests for an operation. You can read more about BETA on my Ph.D [thesis](http://ernestocid.com/files/thesis.pdf) and on the tool's [website](http://www.beta-tool.info/). You can find the tool's code [here](https://github.com/ernestocid/beta1).

WAAT: my undergrad final project. An Eclipse plugin used to generate functional tests for web applications. The tests were automatically generated from requirements written using a controlled natural language. I implemented the language's parser using [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/). The tests were written and executed using [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/ernestocid/waatgenerator).
