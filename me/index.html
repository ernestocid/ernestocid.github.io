beginning, it was just for games and learning cool tricks on MS-DOS. It wasn&rsquo;t until late in school
that I got a taste of programming. Some friends and I found out about free web hosting and started
to code Dragon Ball Z fan sites. The sites had visitor counters, and we competed to see who would
get more visitors. I don&rsquo;t think the concept of SEO was popular back then, so we did our own
marketing by setting the default website in the browsers of the school computers as our websites.
The teachers weren&rsquo;t happy, except for the ones that liked Dragon Ball Z.</p><p>When the time came to choose a college course, picking computer science was a no-brainer. I
didn&rsquo;t know what to expect from the course at first. I was pretty good in the programming and
algorithm subjects, but the math ones were a little scary in the beginning. In the end, I was able
to graduate with good grades. Also, since I was good at programming, I got a software developer
internship in a local company during my third semester. I also helped to start a &ldquo;college company&rdquo;
that developed some web applications for things like college events and registration pages.</p><p>During my time in college, I was a tutor for some programming courses, so my professors advised
me to pursue a professor career. I liked to teach stuff to other people and enjoyed the research
I was doing when I was writing my final dissertation, so this sounded like good advice. With that
in mind, I decided to move to another city and get a master&rsquo;s degree.</p><p>In the end, I got a master&rsquo;s and a Ph.D. in Systems and Computing with an emphasis on
Software Testing and Verification. I got the opportunity to live in Germany for a year
and do research. I always tried to keep my research as practical as possible and developed tools
that put the theory I was working on into practice. By the time I finished my Ph.D. I came to
the conclusion that I liked to study the theoretical stuff but what I really loved was solving
real problems with code and engineering.</p><p>So I decided that a professor&rsquo;s career was not for me and started to look for software
engineering jobs. The switch was not easy. Unfortunately, most people in brazilian companies
don&rsquo;t see much value in academic titles. It felt like I was starting from scratch, but I don&rsquo;t
regret making the switch :-)</p><p>I moved back to my hometown and got a software engineering job at Gocase. There I developed
back-office applications using Ruby on Rails. After a year of working there, I started looking
for bigger challenges. It was nice being closer to family again, but there were not many good
opportunities in my hometown, so I decided to move to São Paulo which is probably the biggest
tech hub in Latin America.</p><p>My first job here was at Bluesoft developing an e-commerce platform that was easily integrated
into the company&rsquo;s main product which was a cloud ERP for medium and large retailers. I also
worked on other projects, but this was the most important one. I had the opportunity to work
with a lot of cool and smart people. My work was also recognized by my peers and i got promoted
three times in two years. It was also the first time I was given the opportunity to work as
a tech lead.</p><p>After two years I thought it was time to move on to a bigger company and I decided to join Loggi.
The company has the huge challenge of providing logistics services in a country that has a
continental size. To solve this challenge there is a lot of technology involved. I joined
the company when it had less than a thousand employees and when it had just got its unicorn title.
So far I saw it grow to four thousand employees and be valued at 2 billion dollars.</p><p>I spent almost six years at Loggi. I started there as a Senior Software Engineer in the Data platform
team and then I had the opportunity to become an Engineering Manager in the Developer Platform team, a
team that I had the pleasure to create and see grow.</p><p>Today I&rsquo;m working as an Engineering Leader at Axonius. That is a fairly recent change in my career
so I don&rsquo;t have much to talk about. I&rsquo;ll bring updates soon :-)</p><p>That is all for now. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll keep this page updated as new things happen in my life :-)</p></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p>© Ernesto Matos | Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com/tomfran/typo/>tomfran/typo</a></p></footer></body><script>function isAuto(){return document.body.classList.contains("auto")}function setTheme(){if(!isAuto())return;document.body.classList.remove("auto");let e="light";window.matchMedia&&window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&(e="dark"),document.body.classList.add(e)}function invertBody(){document.body.classList.toggle("dark"),document.body.classList.toggle("light")}isAuto()&&window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").addListener(invertBody),setTheme()</script></html>
