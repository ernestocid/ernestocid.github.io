I&rsquo;m a Computer Scientist/Software Engineer living in
São Paulo, Brazil. I got a MSc and a Ph.D in computer science during
my time at <a href=http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/>DIMAp/UFRN</a> (and <a href=https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/en/home.html>HHU</a>
for almost a year). During my time in
academia I did research on software testing and formal methods.</p><p>I&rsquo;m currently working as an <del>Software Engineer</del> Engineering Manager at <a href=https://www.loggi.com/>Loggi</a>
trying to reinvent logistics through technology.</p><h2 id=long-bio>Long Bio</h2><p>I got my first computer in 1996 when I was nine years old. It was an Intel Pentium III with 128Mb
of RAM and fewer megabytes of storage than today&rsquo;s free Google Drive plan. It had a cool
turbo button, though :-).</p><p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve spent more time in front of a computer than my parents should allow. In the
beginning, it was just for games and learning cool tricks on MS-DOS. It wasn&rsquo;t until late in school
that I got a taste of programming. Some friends and I found out about free web hosting and started
to code Dragon Ball Z fan sites. The sites had visitor counters, and we competed to see who would
get more visitors. I don&rsquo;t think the concept of SEO was popular back then, so we did our own
marketing by setting the default website in the browsers of the school computers as our websites.
The teachers weren&rsquo;t happy, except for the ones that liked Dragon Ball Z.</p><p>When the time came to choose a college course, picking Computer Science was a no-brainer. I
didn&rsquo;t know what to expect from the course at first. I was pretty good in the programming and
algorithm subjects, but the math ones were a little scary in the beginning. In the end, I was able
to graduate with good grades. Also, since I was good at programming, I got a software developer
internship in a local company during my third semester. I also helped to start a &ldquo;college company&rdquo;
that developed some web applications for things like college events and registration pages.</p><p>During my time in college, I was a tutor for some programming courses, so my professors advised
me to pursue a professor career. I liked to teach stuff to other people and enjoyed the research
I was doing when I was writing my final dissertation, so this sounded like good advice. With that
in mind, I decided to move to another city and get a master&rsquo;s degree.</p><p>In the end, I got a master&rsquo;s and a Ph.D. in Systems and Computing with an emphasis on
software testing and verification. I got the opportunity to live in Germany for a year
and do research. I always tried to keep my research as practical as possible and developed tools
that put the theory I was working on into practice. By the time I finished my Ph.D. I came to
the conclusion that I liked to study the theoretical stuff but what I really loved was solving
real problems with code and engineering.</p><p>So I decided that a professor&rsquo;s career was not for me and started to look for software
engineering jobs. The switch was not easy. Unfortunately, most people in Brazilian companies
don&rsquo;t see much value in academic titles. It felt like I was starting from scratch, but I don&rsquo;t
regret making the switch :-)</p><p>I moved back to my hometown and got a software engineering job at Gocase. There I developed
back-office applications using Ruby on Rails. After a year of working there, I started looking
for bigger challenges. It was nice being closer to family again, but there were not many good
opportunities in my hometown, so I decided to move to São Paulo which is probably the biggest
tech hub in Latin America.</p><p>My first job here was at Bluesoft developing an e-commerce platform that was easily integrated
into the company&rsquo;s main product which was a cloud ERP for medium and large retailers. I also
worked on other projects, but this was the most important one. I had the opportunity to work
with a lot of cool and smart people. My work was also recognized by my peers and I got promoted
three times in two years. It was also the first time I was given the opportunity to work as
a tech lead.</p><p>After two years I thought it was time to move on to a bigger company and I decided to join Loggi.
The company has the huge challenge of providing logistics services in a country that has a
continental size. To solve this challenge there is a lot of technology involved. I joined
the company when it had less than a thousand employees and when it had just got its unicorn title.
So far I saw it grow to four thousand employees and be valued at 2 billion dollars.</p><p>Today I work as an Engineering Manager in the Platform team, a team that I had the opportunity to
create and see grow. We work on tools that increase engineering productivity, reliability of
our platform, among other things.</p><p>That is all for now. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll keep this page updated as new things happen in my life :-)</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="my-4 footer"><div class=container><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-5"><div class="mx-0 mx-md-4 mb-2 text-center text-md-start"><a href=https://ernestocid.github.io/>© 2022 by Ernesto Matos</a></div></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-5"><div class="mx-0 mx-md-4 text-center text-md-end"><a href=https://github.com/ernestocid target=_blank class="mx-1 ml-md-2 mr-md-0 icon" aria-label=GitHub><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-miterlimit="1.414"><path d="M8 0C3.58.0.0 3.582.0 8c0 3.535 2.292 6.533 5.47 7.59.4.075.547-.172.547-.385.0-.19-.007-.693-.01-1.36-2.226.483-2.695-1.073-2.695-1.073-.364-.924-.89-1.17-.89-1.17-.725-.496.056-.486.056-.486.803.056 1.225.824 1.225.824.714 1.223 1.873.87 2.33.665.072-.517.278-.87.507-1.07-1.777-.2-3.644-.888-3.644-3.953.0-.873.31-1.587.823-2.147-.09-.202-.36-1.015.07-2.117.0.0.67-.215 2.2.82.64-.178 1.32-.266 2-.27.68.004 1.36.092 2 .27 1.52-1.035 2.19-.82 2.19-.82.43 1.102.16 1.915.08 2.117.51.56.82 1.274.82 2.147.0 3.073-1.87 3.75-3.65 3.947.28.24.54.73.54 1.48.0 1.07-.01 1.93-.01 2.19.0.21.14.46.55.38C13.71 14.53 16 11.53 16 8c0-4.418-3.582-8-8-8"/></svg></a><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernestocid target=_blank class="mx-1 ml-md-2 mr-md-0 icon" aria-label=Linkedin><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-miterlimit="1.414"><path d="M13.632 13.635h-2.37V9.922c0-.886-.018-2.025-1.234-2.025-1.235.0-1.424.964-1.424 1.96v3.778h-2.37V6H8.51v1.04h.03c.318-.6 1.092-1.233 2.247-1.233 2.4.0 2.845 1.58 2.845 3.637v4.188zM3.558 4.955c-.762.0-1.376-.617-1.376-1.377.0-.758.614-1.375 1.376-1.375.76.0 1.376.617 1.376 1.375.0.76-.617 1.377-1.376 1.377zm1.188 8.68H2.37V6h2.376v7.635zM14.816.0H1.18C.528.0.0.516.0 1.153v13.694C0 15.484.528 16 1.18 16h13.635c.652.0 1.185-.516 1.185-1.153V1.153C16 .516 15.467.0 14.815.0z" fill-rule="nonzero"/></svg></a><a href=/index.xml class="mx-1 ml-md-2 mr-md-0 icon" aria-label=RSS><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-miterlimit="1.414"><path d="M12.8 16C12.8 8.978 7.022 3.2.0 3.2V0c8.777.0 16 7.223 16 16h-3.2zM2.194 11.61c1.21.0 2.195.985 2.195 2.196.0 1.21-.99 2.194-2.2 2.194C.98 16 0 15.017.0 13.806c0-1.21.983-2.195 2.194-2.195zM10.606 16h-3.11c0-4.113-3.383-7.497-7.496-7.497v-3.11c5.818.0 10.606 4.79 10.606 10.607z"/></svg></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-gtEjrD/SeCtmISkJkNUaaKMoLD0//ElJ19smozuHV6z3Iehds+3Ulb9Bn9Plx0x4 crossorigin=anonymous></script>
