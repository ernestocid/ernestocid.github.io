Bellow you will find some of the projects I created.

- BETA: stands for B basEd Testing Approach. It is a tool-supported approach, based on the B-Method formal notation,
to generate test cases. It uses restrictions described on a B model, such as invariants, preconditions and conditional
statements, to create unit tests for an operation. You can read more about BETA on
my Ph.D [thesis](http://ernestocid.com/files/thesis.pdf), in some of the papers [here]({{< ref "/publications" >}} "Publications")
and in the tool's [website](http://www.beta-tool.info/). You can find the tool's code [here](https://github.com/ernestocid/beta1).

- WAAT: my undergrad final project. An Eclipse plugin used to generate functional tests for web applications.
The tests were automatically generated from requirements written using a controlled natural language. I implemented
the language's parser using [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/). The tests were written and executed using
[Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/ernestocid/waatgenerator).
