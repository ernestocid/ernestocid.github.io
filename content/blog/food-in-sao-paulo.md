## Burguers

- [Holy Burguer](https://www.instagram.com/holyburgersp/): when I went, the place was tiny and always packed. I was there on holiday, showed up around lunchtime, got there half an hour before they even opened, and there were already four people in line. I tried the burger that’s ranked [number 3 in the world](https://www.burgerdudes.se/the-worlds-best-burgers/), and yeah—it was really good. The pastrami coxinhas are also a must-try.

- [Big Kahuna Burger](https://www.instagram.com/bigkahunaburgerr/): they call themselves “The Temple of Bacon” and honestly, anything with bacon there is worth trying. They even serve bacon milkshakes.

## Italian

- [MoMa (Modern Mamma Osteria)](https://www.instagram.com/modernmammaosteria/): my favorite Italian restaurant in São Paulo, hands down. The Lasanheta de Vitelo is my go-to every single time.
